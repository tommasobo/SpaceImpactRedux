 * Debris

 * There are four different debris types:<br>
 * <b>Explosion</b> that it's spawned when an entity dies, has a 
 * limited amount of life defined by a countdown.<br>
 * <b>Hit</b> that it's spawned when an entity gets damage, has a 
 * limited amount of life defined by a countdown.<br>
 * <b>Sparkle</b> that it's spawned when the Spaceship get a PowerUp, 
 * has a limited amount of life defined by a countdown.<br>
 * <b>Asteroid</b> that it's spawned randomly and moves across 
 * the gamescreen. He dies as soon as his x location is less than -0.30.<br>
